 * KeyInputFocusManager
 * This class provides the functionality of registering for keyboard events for controls.
 * The keyinput focus manager maintains a stack of controls, With the last added control receiving
 * all the keyboard events first. And if the conrol doesn't consume the event it is passed to
 * the next control in the stack. If none of the controls in the stack consume the key event then
 * UnhandledKeyEventSignal() is emitted.
