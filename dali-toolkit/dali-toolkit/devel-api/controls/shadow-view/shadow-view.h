/**
 *
 * ShadowView is a class for applying shadows to objects present in the view.
 *
 * Basic idea:-
 *
 * 1) The ShadowView object will render all its child actors offscreen from the light's point of view projected on to the shadow plane in a seperate render task.\n
 * 2) The ShadowView object then blurs the result of step 1), using a two pass separated Gaussian blur.\n
 * 3) The ShadowView object gets rendered automatically in the default render task along with it's children.
 *
 * Fundamentally, the ShadowView is simply an Actor in the normal actor tree that affects all of its children. It should be added to your Actor tree and manipulated in the
 * normal way. It can be considered a 'portal' in the sense that all child actors are clipped to the ShadowView actor bounds.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS:
 * The ShadowView is intended to provide simple planar projection shadows, Which means it needs a flat plane to cast shadows. So Shadows can't be cast on other objects.
 *
 * ************\n
 * NB: It is essential to remove the ShadowView from the stage and also to call Deactivate() on it when you are not using it. This will ensure that resources are freed and
 * rendering stops.\n
 * ************\n
 *
 * Usage example:-
 *
 *  @code
 *  // initialise\n
 *  ShadowView shadowView = ShadowView::New();
 *
 *  // create and add some visible actors to the ShadowView, all these child actors will therefore cast a shadow.
 *  Image image = Image::New(...);
 *  ImageActor imageActor = ImageActor::New(image);
 *  imageActor.SetParentOrigin( ParentOrigin::CENTER );
 *  imageActor.SetAnchorPoint( AnchorPoint::CENTER );
 *  shadowView.Add(imageActor);\n Add the renderable actor to the shadow view
 *
 *  ImageActor shadowPlane = ImageActor::New(); //This will be the shadow plane
 *  shadowPlane.SetParentOrigin( ParentOrigin::CENTER );
 *  shadowPlane.SetAnchorPoint( AnchorPoint::CENTER );
 *  shadowPlane.SetSize(700.0f, 700.0f);
 *  shadowPlane.SetPosition( Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f, -30.0f) ); //Just behind the image actor.
 *  shadowPlane.SetShadowPlane(ShadowPlane);
 *
 *  Actor pointLight = Actor::New(); // This will be the light source
 *  pointLight.SetPosition(300.0f, 250.0f, 600.0f);
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Add(pointLight);
 *  shadowView.SetPointLight(pointLight);
 *
 *  // Start rendering the ShadowView
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Add(ShadowPlane);
 *  shadowView.Activate();
 *  ...
 *
 *  // animate the strength of the blur - this can fade between no blur and full blur. See GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex().
 *  Animation blurAnimation = Animation::New( ... );
 *  blurAnimation.AnimateTo( Property( shadowView, shadowView.GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex() ), ... );
 *  blurAnimation.Play();
 *
 *  ...
 *  // Stop rendering the ShadowView
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Remove(shadowView);
 *  shadowView.Deactivate();
 *  @endcode
