/**
 *
 * BloomView is a class for applying a render process that intensifies and blurs the bright parts of an image, bleeding bright areas into darker ones and making bright
 * light look more realistic.
 *
 * Basic idea:-
 *
 * 1) The BloomView object will render all its child actors offscreen.\n
 * 2) The BloomView object then extract the parts of that image that are brighter than the bloom threshold.\n
 * 3) The BloomView object then blurs the result of step 2), which makes the brightness bleed into surrounding areas.\n
 * 3) The BloomView object then composites the bloom from step 3) with the child actors image from step 1), using parameters that can be set by the user.
 * The compositing is additive (image + bloom).\n
 * 4) The BloomView object gets rendered automatically, either to the screen via the default render task, or via a RenderTask the user has created for
 * e.g. further offscreen rendering.
 *
 * Fundamentally, the BloomView is simply an Actor in the normal actor tree that affects all of its children. It should be added to your Actor tree and manipulated in the
 * normal ways. It can be considered a 'portal' in the sense that all child actors are clipped to the BloomView actor bounds.
 *
 * ************\n
 * NB: It is essential to remove the BloomView from the stage and also to call Deactivate() on it when you are not using it. This will ensure that resources are freed and
 * rendering stops.\n
 * ************\n
 *
 *
 * Usage example:-
 *
 *  // initialise\n
 *  BloomView bloomView = BloomView::New();\n
 *
 *  // create and add some visible actors to the BloomView, all these child actors will therefore get bloomed\n
 *  Image image = Image::New(...);\n
 *  ImageActor imageActor = ImageActor::New(image);\n
 *  bloomView.Add(imageActor);\n
 *  ...\n
 *
 *  // Start rendering the BloomView\n
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Add(bloomView);\n
 *  bloomView.Activate();\n
 *  ...\n
 *
 *  // animate the strength of the bloom - this can fade between no bloom and your desired max bloom. See GetBloomIntensityPropertyIndex().\n
 *  Animation blurAnimation = Animation::New( ... );\n
 *  blurAnimation.AnimateTo( Property( bloomView, bloomView.GetBloomIntensityPropertyIndex() ), ... );\n
 *  blurAnimation.Play();\n
 *
 *  ...\n
 *  // Stop rendering the BloomView\n
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Remove(bloomView);\n
 *  bloomView.Deactivate();\n
