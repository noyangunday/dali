# DALi 3D ( Dynamic Animation Library ) {#dali-introduction}

DALi is a quick and easy way of allowing developers to create Rich UI Applications like:

 + Image & Video galleries
 + Music players
 + Games
 + Maps
 + Homescreens / launch pads
 + Advanced watch faces for wearable devices

DALi is based on OpenGL ES 2.0 & 3.0, however it hides the complexity of
the OpenGL API from developers and provides a clean cross-platform C++ & JavaScript framework.

## Features {#dali-features}

 + Create Images & Text
 + Create shaders using GLSL
 + Provide multiple cameras and render targets
 + Provides Layers to aid in 2D UI layout
 + Easy to use Animation framework
 + Automatic background loading of resources ( images / text / meshes )
 + Runs all animations in a seperate thread. This helps maintain 60 FPS even if JavaScript is performing a long operation ( e.g. Garbage Collection ).
 + Provides keyboard / touch / mouse handling
