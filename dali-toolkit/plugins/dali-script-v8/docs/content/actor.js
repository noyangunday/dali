 ## Actor API

  Actor is the primary object with which Dali applications interact. UI controls can be built by combining multiple actors.

  There are different types of Actors supported by Dali. They all have the same
  base functionality of the actor class.

```
var actor = new dali.Actor();
var imageActor = new dali.ImageActor();
var textActor = new dali.TextActor("hello world");
var camera = new dali.CameraActor();
var layer = new dali.Layer();
```

### Hello world example
```
var myActor = new dali.TextActor("hello-world");

myActor.name = "my first actor";
myActor.color = [ 1, 0, 0, 1];    // Red,Green,Blue, Alpha ( 1 == max, 0 = none )
myActor.scale = [ 2, 2, 1];      // double the width and height

// by default an actor is anchored to the top-left of it's parent actor
// change it to the middle

myActor.parentOrigin = [0.5,0.5,0.5];

// add to the stage
dali.stage.add( myActor );
```


### Positioning Actors

An actor inherits its parent's position.  The relative position between the actor & parent is determined by 3 properties:

1) ParentOrigin.  This Vector3 property defines a point within the parent actor's area.

![ ](../assets/img/parent-origin.png)


The default is "top-left", which can be visualized in 2D as (0, 0), but is actually Vector3(0, 0, 0.5) in the 3D DALi world.  The actor's position is relative to this point.
```
// to change parent origin to the centre
myActor.parentOrigin = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5];
```

2) AnchorPoint.  This Vector3 property defines a point within the child actor's area.

![ ](../assets/img/anchor-point.png)

The default is "center", which can be visualized in 2D as (0.5, 0.5), but is actually Vector3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5) in the 3D DALi world.  The actor's position is also relative to this point.
```
// setting anchor point to the centre
myActor.anchorPoint = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5];
```

3) Position.  This is the position vector between the parent-origin and anchor-point.

![ ](../assets/img/actor-position.png)

Therefore by default, an actors position is the distance between its center and the top-left corner of its parent.

An actor added directly to the stage with position (X = stageWidth*0.5, Y = stageHeight*0.5), would appear in the center of the screen.  Likewise an actor with position (X = actorWidth*0.5, Y = actorWidth*0.5), would appear at the top-left of the screen.

Note that since DALi is a 3D toolkit, this behaviour is the result of a default perspective camera setup.

### Actor callback events

The actor provides the following call back events

| Name              | Description                            | Parameters passed to call back |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|touched            | touch event                            | (actor, touchEvent )     |
|hovered            | mouse or pointer hovering over actor   | (actor, hoverEvent)      |
|mouse-wheel-event  | mouse wheel events                     | (actor, wheelEvent)      |
|on-stage           | actor has been moved on stage          | (actor)                  |
|off-stage          | actor has been moved off stage         | (actor)                  |


#### Touch event

Used to detect multiple touch events on the actor. The state of each touch point can be:
+ "down"        = touch down
+ "up"          = Touch up
+ "motion"      = Finger dragged or hovered
+ "leave"       =  Leave the boundary of an actor
+ "stationary"  = No change from last event.  Useful when a multi-point event occurs where
all points are sent but indicates that this particular point has not changed since the last time
+ "interrupted"  = A system event has occurred which has interrupted the touch or hover event sequence



```
touchEvent = {
  
  pointCount: int,  // number of points touched ( multi-touch )
  time: int,        // The time in milliseconds that the touch event occurred.
  points = [ touchPoints ],    // array of TouchPoints, to support
  
  TouchPoint = {
  
    "deviceId" : int,      // Each touch point has a unique device ID
    "state" : string,      // touch state ="down,up,motion,leave,stationary, interrupted }
    "sourceActor" : actor, // the actor that is emitting the callback (the actor that is hit maybe a child of it)
    "hitActor" : actor,    // actor that was hit
    "local" :  {x,y},      // co-ordinates of top left of hit actor (local.x, local.y)
    "screen" : {x,y}       // co-ordinates of top left of hit actor (screen.x, screen.y)
    }
}

function OnPressed( actor, touchEvent )
{
  var firstPoint = touchEvent.points[0];
  log("first touch point = " + firstPoint.screen.x + "," +firstPoint.screen.x + "actor= "+firstPoint.hitActor );
  
  var anim = new dali.Animation( 4 );
  var rotation = new dali.Rotation( 90, 0, 0 ); // pitch, yaw, roll
  anim.animateBy( actor, "rotation", rotation );
  anim.play();
  return true;
}
  
// connect to touch events
myActor.connect( "touched", onPressed );

```

#### Hover event

```
hoverEvent = {
  
  pointCount  // number of points hovered over
  time        // The time in milliseconds that the hover event occurred.
  points[]    // array of TouchPoints
  
  TouchPoint = {
      // See touchEvent TouchPoint object
  }
}
```
      // connect to touch events
      myActor.connect( "hovered", onHover);

#### Mouse wheel event

```
mouseWheelEvent = {
  
  direction,       // "vertical" or "horizontal" direction the wheel is being rolled
  shiftPressed,    // boolean, shift key is held
  ctrlPressed,     // boolean, ctrl key is held
  altPressed,      // boolean, alt key is held
  keyModifiers,    // bitmask of keys pressed
  point {x,y},     // The co-ordinates of the mouse cursor relative to the top-left of the screen when the wheel is being rolled.
  rolled,          // offset of mouse wheel rolling, positive = rolling down, negative = rolling up
  timestamp        // The time in milliseconds that the mouse event occurred
}
  
// connect to touch events
myActor.connect( "mouse-wheel-event", onMouseWheel );
```
#### Key events

Key events are performed using the dali.stage object and dali.keyboardFocusManager.
